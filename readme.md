# Makey-Makey

Time to make things with things! Not with code!

(We'll work on putting the two together in your final project, if you don't already have one.)

You will be working in pairs.

### Goals of this project
The goals of this project are several:

* To get you thinking about computers in a different, more physical way
* To teach you the very basics of circuits
* To get you to use the Makey Makey
* To hasten the project of scope transfer from the lab to the humanities
* To provoke you to question what counts as the "matter" or "material" of computing
* To have some fun

### Project Specifics and Specs
This project has three interleaved aspects:

* A working(ish) prototype
* A design document
* A demo

#### Specs: Making
You should make a basically functioning (but not complete) rough prototype of your project. This should be as follows:

You will extend, redesign, modify, or break in some significant way an already-existing computer interface. This can be whatever you want, as long as it exists in the world and can be made somehow interesting by virtue of having a Makey Makey talking to some objects added onto it.

The specs here are very simple:
* It should use the Makey Makey in some fashion
* It should allow the user to interact with the system largely without the aid of a mouse and keyboard
* If it is not a polished interface (and indeed, it won't be), it should at least suggest a more final, integrated, less janky form

#### Specs: Writing
In addition to the rough prototype, you will write a design document. In this assignment, the *what* is substantially less important than the *why*.

Your design document should be posted to one of your two blogs **not later than 11:59pm on Monday, April 11.** The design document has the following specifications:

* The document should be as equally coauthored as possible
* The document should have three main sections: **Goals**, **Specifications**, and **Rationale**

The **Goals** section of the document should outline at least three and no more than five major goals of the project. This portion of the document should meet the following specifications:
* The goals should be clearly enumerated, named briefly and plainly.
* Each goal should be followed by a paragraph (of 150â€“300 words) describing the aim in greater detail, and answer the following questions:
  * What do you want the user do?
  * What do you want the user feel?
  * What do you want the user think?

The **Specifications** section of the document should outline what, exactly, you should build, and how the parts are connected, e.g. "When the user touches the flower, the sound triggers." These should be detailed, if not exhaustive. The idea is that somebody else should be able to, from your specifications, construct your prototype from your specs and a Makey Makey.

The **Rationale** section of the document should explain why you made the design choices that you made, in a schematic way. Here are the specs:

* This portion of the document should be approximately 1,000 words (+/- 20%)
* It should make reference to at least two authors we have read in class
* It should cast your goals in terms of the larger themes of the course (materiality, neoliberalism, etc.). Put another way, it should articulate the humanistic and/or aesthetic problems towards which it is oriented.
* It should motivate your choice of system, your goals, and your specific choices in terms of those larger themes. Why this specific system? Are you making something easier? Harder?  Why? To what end?
* It should specify something of what you have learned in the process of making your project.

#### Specs: Demo
In the "lab" portion of the class on Thursday, April 7, each pair of students will present their Makey Makey project to the class. Each pair will setup, install, and demo their project in the lab portion of the class. The Demo should last approximately 10 minutes. Depending on student demand, the setup time will last somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes. After the demo, each group will receive, in good art school tradition, a "crit" (critique) of 5 to 10 minutes after the demo, including discussion of what worked, what didn't.

You may wish to revise your design document in light of crits.
